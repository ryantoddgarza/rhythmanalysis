# Lesson 1: Get Started

## Introduction

This system is an approach to rhythmic composition or improvisation that produces polymetric and polyrhythmic structures that can evolve analogous to geometric shapes in multiple dimensions.

## Unlearning

Let's first discuss the suppositions from a typical approach to rhythm that can be temporarily suspended to make ease of what is to follow. Fitting standardized terminology to a new method would be limiting. Translation to existing contexts will be a simpler process once the concepts have been established rather than the inverse.

Elementary rhythm is often taught as a set of macro variables that impose a structure on micro elements. Students learn to conceive musical rhythm as grouped segments determined by a meter (typically a fraction) whose divisor progresses through time at a certain tempo and whose constituent elements are devised through methods based on those variables. Following this line of thinking, a 4/4 meter that progresses at 60 beats per minute can bring about eighth notes (denominator divided by 2), half notes (denominator multiplied by two), meter changes (numerator incremented or decremented), and so on.

I once had a teacher refer to this as cutting the cake. This approach no doubt can and has produced interesting complexities, but is only one way of approaching rhythmic possibilities. I imagine it as the Euclidian geometry of a two dimensional triangle. The sum of the internal angles will always equal one hundred and eighty degrees. But turning to spherical geometry, if you place the same triangle on a convex or concave surface, now the sum depends on a new factor: the surface. What I imagine with this system is flexing the surface one way, sometimes the other, and sometimes leaving it flat, creating rhythmic complexity that fits with standard approaches and can always return to a simpler form.

Approaching from the opposite direction is a subtle but significant shift in thinking. Rather than derive rhythmic events from methods based on the meter, each rhythmic instance inherits similar methods. This means that with every event emerges a possibility for modification; for bending the surface.

So let's put aside any concept of time signature, beat, or note value and begin from a slightly more abstracted place.

## Thought experiments

Snap your fingers _now_. Is that event a member of some rhythm? I think no. Snap your fingers again _now_. Does the emergent relationship redefine the first event as belonging to some rhythm? I think yes. For all we may know about an event, emergence of new meaning is infinitely possible. The present redefines the past and is thus dependent the future.
