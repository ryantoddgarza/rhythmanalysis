# Lesson 3: Metric Methods

## Objectives

- Expound the parameters on which methods can operate
- Define the possible mathematical operations for a metric event

## Events in time

A relationship to another quantity is necessary to define a point in time. Consider two events separated by one hundred milliseconds.

## Methods

An event's methods belong to its prototype expressed in [EventPrototype.js](examples/EventPrototype.js).

### Multiply

by zero is zero.

### Divide

by zero is infinity.

### Add

### Subtract
