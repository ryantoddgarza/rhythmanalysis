# Lesson 4: Inheritance

## Objectives

- Define the inherited properties of a metric event

## Sort of a fractal but probably not

Use an array to represent the denominator possibilities of two points in time.

```
denominators = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
# continue ad infinitum
```

Each metric event inherits this array and can be represented as _e_ = subdivisions.

```
1 = denominators
2 = denominators
3 = denominators
# continue ad infinitum
```

Since every metric event is defined by a set of data equal to itself, a fractal emerges.

```
n: {
  n: {
    n: {
      n: {
        # continue ad infinitum
      }
    }
  }
}
```
