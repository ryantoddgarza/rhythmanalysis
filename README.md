## What is this?

This repository is a conceptual playground for rhythmic inquiry which seems to have a beginning in my earliest childhood stages of cognition. Through fortunate circumstances and opportunities for study, mentorship, and implementation over the years, an instinctive approach to rhythmic improvisation and composition has emerged that a handful of peers have deemed worthy of documentation.

In this format, I aim to consolidate and refine the many clumsy attempts to expound this topic with pen and paper, computer documents, and that still incomplete blog post called [superimposed-recursive-metric-modulation](https://ryantoddgarza.com/superimposed-recursive-metric-modulation).
