## What is this?

This repository is a conceptual playground for rhythmic inquiry which seems to have a beginning near my earliest childhood stages of cognition. Through endless fortunate circumstances and opportunities for study, mentorship, and implementation over the years, I've come to recognize an instinctive approach to rhythmic improvisation and composition that at least a handful of peers have deemed worthy of documentation.
