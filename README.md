## What is this?

This repository is a conceptual playground for rhythmic inquiry which seems to have a beginning in my earliest childhood stages of cognition. Through fortunate opportunities for study with mentors and exploratory implementation over the years, an instinctive approach to rhythmic improvisation and composition has emerged that a handful of peers have deemed worthy of documentation.

In this format, I aim to amalgamate and refine my clumsy attempts over the years to expound this topic on napkins, in notebooks, computer documents, and that still incomplete blog post crudely named [superimposed-recursive-metric-modulation](https://ryantoddgarza.com/superimposed-recursive-metric-modulation).
